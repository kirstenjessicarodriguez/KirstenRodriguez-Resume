        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Kirsten Rodriguez. I currently reside in Riverside, California, but I have lived in several cities across my life. My journey through academia has been a dynamic one, marked by transitions between different states and schools. Having spent my formative high school years split between Centennial High School in Franklin, Tennessee, and Wissahickon High School in Ambler, Pennsylvania, I have not only adapted to diverse educational environments but also actively contributed to the communities I was a part ofâ€“no matter how long I was a part of them. My engagement at Centennial High School went beyond the classroom, as I found my niche as a photographer for the school yearbook. Capturing the vibrant essence of various clubs and activities, including the much-anticipated cultural assembly, allowed me to merge my love for photography with a sense of community involvement. Additionally, my commitment to civic responsibility led me to join the Young Democrats club, where I participated in voting drives and community outreach efforts, advocating for causes that resonated with our local community. 
<br><br>

        The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic prompted a shift to online learning for me, leading to my enrollment in online academies hosted by both Centennial High School and Wissahickon High School during my time in Tennessee and Pennsylvania, respectively. Although the virtual setting limited my participation in traditional school-sanctioned clubs and activities, I compensated by immersing myself in a rigorous schedule of Advanced Placement (AP) classes, further fueling my intellectual curiosity and commitment to academic excellence. Beyond academics, I have dedicated my time to volunteer work, fostering a sense of social responsibility from a young age. These experiences instilled in me a deep appreciation for community service and a passion for contributing to the well-being of others. My interests extend beyond the academic realm, as I find solace in self-expression through activities like nail art, indulging in cinematic experiences, and delving into the rich narratives of literature. These personal pursuits serve as a balance to the intensity of my academic commitments, providing me with a well-rounded perspective on life. 
<br><br>

        As I navigate my sophomore year at UC Riverside, pursuing a degree in Sociology with a potential minor in Gender Studies, my commitment to societal change and understanding economic systems remains unwavering. I am driven by a fervent advocacy for equity and justice, motivated by the belief that positive change begins with individual contributions to a collective cause. While my professional journey is yet to begin, my extensive volunteer experience has laid the foundation for a future dedicated to making a positive impact on the world around me. I have volunteered at the Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center In Nashville, Tennessee, participated in a number of cancer walks, and have meticulously crafted expressions of gratitude in the form of thank-you notes, extending appreciation to the participants of a cancer awareness event. As I continue to explore my academic interests and engage with diverse communities, I look forward to the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead, confident in my ability to contribute meaningfully to the betterment of society.
